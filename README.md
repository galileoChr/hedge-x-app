# HedgeTradeX - Next-Gen DeFi Trading Protocol

In this project, I'm building HedgeTradeX, a decentralized trading protocol that aims to democratize institutional-grade trading strategies for everyday DeFi users. The core innovation is enabling users to execute simple/complex trading strategies without requiring significant upfront capital.

## Current Status: Early Prototype

This repository contains an early prototype/proof of concept of the HedgeTradeX interface. While the frontend demonstrates the intended user experience and core features, I'm actively working on:

- Implementing the full smart contract infrastructure
- Developing advanced trading strategies
- Building robust security measures
- Optimizing gas efficiency
- Expanding cross-chain capabilities

## Core Features (Planned)

- Capital-efficient trading through innovative DeFi mechanisms
- Real-time market monitoring across multiple DEXs
- Advanced risk management systems
- Multi-chain support (starting with Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon)
- Institutional-grade execution engine
- Automated strategy execution

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 13, React, TailwindCSS
- Web3: wagmi, RainbowKit
- UI Components: shadcn/ui
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom animations

## Important Note

This is a prototype version focused on demonstrating the user interface and core concepts. The backend infrastructure, smart contracts, and actual trading functionality are still under active development. I'm working on a more comprehensive version that will include:

- Production-ready smart contracts
- Advanced security features
- Improved gas optimization
- Extended cross-chain support
- Enhanced risk management systems

## Roadmap

I'm currently focused on:
1. Completing the core smart contract infrastructure
2. Implementing advanced security measures
3. Optimizing cross-chain execution
4. Building out additional trading strategies
5. Expanding DEX integrations

This project represents my vision for democratizing institutional-grade trading strategies in DeFi. While this version serves as a proof of concept, I'm actively working on the full implementation that will bring this vision to life.
